title: "Nominatim 4.4.0 and Photon 0.5.0 released"
author: Sarah Hoffmann (lonvia)

We are happy to announce that this week new versions of Nominatim and its
ElasticSearch frontend Photon have been released.

Version 4.4.0 of Nominatim brings many bug fixes and performance improvements
for the new Python frontend, which was introduced in version 4.3.0. It can
now be considered stable and has become the frontend recommended to be used
for new installations. You find [deployment guides](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/admin/Deployment-Python/)
for the Python frontend in the documentation. There is no need to reimport
your existing database. It will work perfectly fine with the new frontend.

A new feature in this release is experimental support for exporting a
Nominatim database to SQLite. The SQLite database can then be used with the
new Python frontend or when using the Nominatim library. For more information
about this, watch the talk at [SotM-EU 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBLuSZ4TOfw)
or read about it in the [SQLite blog posts](https://nominatim.org/2023/10/25/sqlite-reverse.html).

Version 0.5.0 of Photon brings back the ability to update a Photon database
from a Nominatim database. The new mechanism is better decoupled from the
Nominatim update process, making it easier to handle. A long-standing issue
around UIDs of house numbers documents has been fixed so that all data should
now be correctly handled. This version also introduces a new API endpoint
`/nominatim-update/status` which allows scripts to check if an update is
already in progress. To find out if your Photon database is indeed up-to-date
use the newlt added `/status` endpoint.

If you do not use the update facility, then the Photon release remains
compatible with version 0.4 database dumps including the ones available on
[https://download1.graphhopper.com/public](https://download1.graphhopper.com/public).
If you want to run updates, you need to create a fresh import using this
release. Please be aware that updates now require an additional preparation
step. Consult the README for more information.
